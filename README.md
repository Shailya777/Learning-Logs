# Learning-Logs
A running record of my daily and weekly practice as I learn Python, SQL, and other tools required for data analytics / data science. 
This repo holds my rough code exercises, micro-projects, and reflections. Not polished portfolio work, but demonstrations of steady progress and continual learning.

## How It’s Organized

- **Folders topic:** Each contains code files, notes, and examples of concepts or challenges I’ve learned.
- **Weekly Check-ins:** Markdown summaries of what I studied, built, and learned.

## Why I Made This Repo

- To track my personal growth.
- To share my learning process: Open to fellow learners, feedback, and anyone on a similar path.
- To build discipline.
  
## Recent Milestones

- [ ] Finished basics of Python functions, control flow, and OOP practice scripts—including input validation, inheritance, and using classes for the first time.
- [ ] Built first micro-apps: PhoneBook, Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Next Steps

- Continue logging weekly mini-projects and roadblocks.
- Turn learning notes and check-ins into regular pushes and green squares!
- Use this as my public “proof-of-learning” until projects are big enough for main portfolio repos.
